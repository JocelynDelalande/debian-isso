.SH WHAT'S ISSO?
.sp
Isso is a lightweight commenting server similar to Disqus. It allows anonymous
comments, maintains identity and is simple to administrate. It uses JavaScript
and cross\-origin ressource sharing for easy integration into static websites.
.SH NO, I MEANT "ISSO"
.sp
Isso is an informal, german abbreviation for "Ich schrei sonst!", which can
roughly be translated to "I\(aqm yelling otherwise". It usually ends the
discussion without any further arguments.
.sp
In germany, Isso \fI\%is also pokémon N° 360\fP\&.
.SH WHAT'S WRONG WITH DISQUS?
.sp
No anonymous comments (IP address, email and name recorded), hosted in the USA,
third\-party. Just like IntenseDebate, livefrye etc. When you embed Disqus, they
can do anything with your readers (and probably mine Bitcoins, see the loading
times).
.SH SETUP
.SS Quickstart
.sp
Assuming you have successfully \fBinstalled\fP Isso, here\(aqs
a quickstart quide that covers common setups. Sections covered:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Configuration\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Migration\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Running Isso\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Integration\fP

\fI\%Going Further\fP
.UNINDENT
.SS Configuration
.sp
You must provide a custom configuration. Most default parameters are useful for
development, not persistence. The two most important options are \fIdbpath\fP to
set the location of your database and your website\(aqs name \fIhost\fP where you want
to comment on:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[general]
; database location, check permissions, created if not exists
dbpath = /var/lib/isso/comments.db
; your website or blog (not the location of Isso!)
host = http://example.tld/
; you can add multiple hosts for local development
; or SSL connections. There is no wildcard to allow
; any domain.
host =
    http://localhost:1234/
    http://example.tld/
    https://example.tld/
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note, that multiple, \fIdifferent\fP websites are \fBnot\fP supported in a single
configuration. To serve comments for diffent websites, refer to
\fIMultiple Sites\fP\&.
.sp
You moderate Isso through signed URLs sent by email or logged. By default,
comments are accepted and immediately shown to other users. To enable
moderation queue, add:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[moderation]
enabled = true
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To moderate comments, either use the activation or deletion URL in the logs or
\fIuse SMTP\fP to get notified on new comments including the
URLs for activation and deletion:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[general]
notify = smtp
[smtp]
; SMTP settings
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For more details, see \fBserver\fP and
\fBclient\fP configuration.
.SS Migration
.sp
You can migrate your existing comments from \fI\%Disqus\fP\&. Log into Disqus, go to
your website, click on \fIDiscussions\fP and select the \fIExport\fP tab. You\(aqll
receive an email with your comments. Unfortunately, Disqus does not export
up\- and downvotes.
.sp
To import existing comments, run Isso with your new configuration file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
~> isso \-c /path/to/isso.cfg import user\-2013\-09\-02T11_39_22.971478\-all.xml
[100%]  53 threads, 192 comments
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Running Isso
.sp
To run Isso, simply execute:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ isso \-c /path/to/isso.cfg run
2013\-11\-25 15:31:34,773 INFO: connected to HTTP server
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Next, we configure \fI\%Nginx\fP to proxy Isso. Do not run Isso on a public interface!
A popular but often error\-prone (because of \fI\%CORS\fP) setup to host Isso uses a
dedicated domain such as \fBcomments.example.tld\fP\&.
.sp
Assuming both, your website and Isso are on the same server, the nginx
configuration looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
server {
    listen [::]:80 default ipv6only=off;
    server_name example.tld;
    root ...;
}

server {
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name comments.example.tld;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_set_header X\-Forwarded\-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X\-Forwarded\-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Integration
.sp
Now, you embed Isso to your website:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<script data\-isso="//comments.example.tld/"
        src="//comments.example.tld/js/embed.min.js"></script>

<section id="isso\-thread"></section>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note, that \fIdata\-isso\fP is optional, but when a website includes a script using
\fBasync\fP it is no longer possible to determine the script\(aqs external URL.
.sp
That\(aqs it. When you open your website, you should see a commenting form. Leave
a comment to see if the setup works. If not, see \fBtroubleshooting\fP\&.
.SS Going Further
.sp
There are several server and client configuration options uncovered in this
quickstart, check out \fBconfiguration/server\fP and
\fBconfiguration/client\fP for more information. For further website
integration, see \fBextras/advanced\-integration\fP\&.
.sp
If you wondered how to automatically start Isso you may find a short script
for various popular init/supervisor daemons here: \fBinstall\fP\&. Another
important topic is the actual \fBdeployment of Isso\fP
(and every Python web application in general).
